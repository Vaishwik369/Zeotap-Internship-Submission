Data Science Intern Assignment - Vaishwik Vishwakarma
This repository contains the solution to the Data Science Intern Assignment based on the provided eCommerce Transactions Dataset. The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike Model development, and Customer Segmentation (Clustering).

Project Structure
The repository contains the following files and folders:

Vaishwik_Vishwakarma_EDA.pdf: Report on exploratory data analysis and business insights.
Vaishwik_Vishwakarma_EDA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing EDA code.
Vaishwik_Vishwakarma_Lookalike.csv: CSV file with the top 3 lookalike recommendations for the first 20 customers.
Vaishwik_Vishwakarma_Lookalike.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the lookalike model development.
Vaishwik_Vishwakarma_Clustering.pdf: Report on customer segmentation results.
Vaishwik_Vishwakarma_Clustering.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the clustering code.
Assignment Overview
The project is divided into three main tasks:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
Goal: Derive actionable insights from customer, product, and transaction data.
Deliverables:
Business insights on customer distribution, product preferences, and transaction patterns.
PDF and Jupyter Notebook with EDA and insights.
2. Lookalike Model
Goal: Develop a recommendation model that identifies similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
Deliverables:
A Lookalike.csv file mapping customer IDs to the top 3 similar customers and their similarity scores.
Jupyter Notebook detailing the model's development and logic.
3. Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
Goal: Segment customers into clusters based on their profile and transaction data.
Deliverables:
Clustering report with metrics (e.g., DB Index) and visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook with clustering implementation.
Key Insights & Results
EDA Highlights
Customers are distributed across regions, highlighting opportunities for targeted campaigns.
Certain product categories dominate sales, influencing inventory and promotions.
High-value transactions suggest bulk purchases or premium items suitable for personalized engagement.
Lookalike Model
Recommends 3 similar customers for each of the first 20 customers.
Incorporates customer profiles and transaction history.
Clustering
Segmentation using K-Means clustering with Min-Max normalization.
Optimal clusters: 2, with a Davies-Bouldin Index value of 0.5840.
Clusters are visualized to identify spending patterns and transaction behaviors.
Tools & Techniques Used
Languages: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
Clustering Algorithm: K-Means
Scaling Method: Min-Max Normalization
